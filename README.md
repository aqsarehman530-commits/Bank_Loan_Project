# Bank_Loan_Project
## Project Objective
An interactive Bank Loan Report Dashboard built in Excel to analyze loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, and customer behavior. The dashboard helps visualize loan performance trends and provides actionable insights for decision-making.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
&quot;In order to monitor and assess our bank&#39;s lending activities and performance, we need to
create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key
loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven
decisions, track our loan portfolio&#39;s health, and identify trends that can inform our lending
strategies.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications
received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-
to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans
is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and
analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is
essential for assessing the bank&#39;s cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse
the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-
Month (MoM) changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD,
and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will
provide insights into our lending portfolio&#39;s overall cost.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers
helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all
loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s
In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our
loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between &#39;Good
Loans&#39; and &#39;Bad Loans&#39; based on specific loan status criteria
Good Loan KPIs:
1. Good Loan Application Percentage: We need to calculate the percentage of loan
applications classified as &#39;Good Loans.&#39; This category includes loans with a loan status
of &#39;Fully Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
2. Good Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications falling
under the &#39;Good Loan&#39; category, which consists of loans with a loan status of &#39;Fully
Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
3. Good Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as
&#39;Good Loans.&#39; This includes the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of &#39;Fully
Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
4. Good Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from
borrowers for &#39;Good Loans,&#39; which encompasses all payments made on loans with a
loan status of &#39;Fully Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
Bad Loan KPIs:
1. Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculating the percentage of loan applications
categorized as &#39;Bad Loans.&#39; This category specifically includes loans with a loan status
of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
2. Bad Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications categorized
as &#39;Bad Loans,&#39; which consists of loans with a loan status of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
3. Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as &#39;Bad
Loans.&#39; This comprises the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of &#39;Charged
Off.&#39;
4. Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from
borrowers for &#39;Bad Loans,&#39; which includes all payments made on loans with a loan
status of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the
performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by &#39;Loan Status.&#39; This
report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators
associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as &#39;Total Loan
Applications,&#39; &#39;Total Funded Amount,&#39; &#39;Total Amount Received,&#39; &#39;Month-to-Date (MTD)
Funded Amount,&#39; &#39;MTD Amount Received,&#39; &#39;Average Interest Rate,&#39; and &#39;Average Debt-to-
Income Ratio (DTI),&#39; this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess
the health of our loan portfolio.
