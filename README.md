## PROBLEM STATEMENT
DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
&quot;In order to monitor and assess our bank&#39;s lending activities and performance, we need to
create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key
loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven
decisions, track our loan portfolio&#39;s health, and identify trends that can inform our lending
strategies.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications
received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-
to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans
is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and
analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is
essential for assessing the bank&#39;s cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse
the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-
Month (MoM) changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD,
and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will
provide insights into our lending portfolio&#39;s overall cost.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers
helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all
loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s
In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our
loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between &#39;Good
Loans&#39; and &#39;Bad Loans&#39; based on specific loan status criteria
Good Loan KPIs:
1. Good Loan Application Percentage: We need to calculate the percentage of loan
applications classified as &#39;Good Loans.&#39; This category includes loans with a loan status
of &#39;Fully Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
2. Good Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications falling
under the &#39;Good Loan&#39; category, which consists of loans with a loan status of &#39;Fully
Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
3. Good Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as
&#39;Good Loans.&#39; This includes the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of &#39;Fully
Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
4. Good Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from
borrowers for &#39;Good Loans,&#39; which encompasses all payments made on loans with a
loan status of &#39;Fully Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
Bad Loan KPIs:
1. Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculating the percentage of loan applications
categorized as &#39;Bad Loans.&#39; This category specifically includes loans with a loan status
of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
2. Bad Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications categorized
as &#39;Bad Loans,&#39; which consists of loans with a loan status of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
3. Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as &#39;Bad
Loans.&#39; This comprises the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of &#39;Charged
Off.&#39;
4. Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from
borrowers for &#39;Bad Loans,&#39; which includes all payments made on loans with a loan
status of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the
performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by &#39;Loan Status.&#39; This
report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators
associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as &#39;Total Loan
Applications,&#39; &#39;Total Funded Amount,&#39; &#39;Total Amount Received,&#39; &#39;Month-to-Date (MTD)
Funded Amount,&#39; &#39;MTD Amount Received,&#39; &#39;Average Interest Rate,&#39; and &#39;Average Debt-to-
Income Ratio (DTI),&#39; this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess
the health of our loan portfolio.
DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW
In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics
and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful
view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to
gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. Below are the specific chart
requirements:

DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS
In our Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive &#39;Details
Dashboard&#39; that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan
data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics
and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-
friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users
seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
