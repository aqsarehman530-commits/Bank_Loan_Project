## PROBLEM STATEMENT
DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
&quot;In order to monitor and assess our bank&#39;s lending activities and performance, we need to
create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key
loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven
decisions, track our loan portfolio&#39;s health, and identify trends that can inform our lending
strategies.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications
received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-
to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans
is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and
analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is
essential for assessing the bank&#39;s cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse
the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-
Month (MoM) changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD,
and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will
provide insights into our lending portfolio&#39;s overall cost.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers
helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all
loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s
In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our
loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between &#39;Good
Loans&#39; and &#39;Bad Loans&#39; based on specific loan status criteria
Good Loan KPIs:
1. Good Loan Application Percentage: We need to calculate the percentage of loan
applications classified as &#39;Good Loans.&#39; This category includes loans with a loan status
of &#39;Fully Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
2. Good Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications falling
under the &#39;Good Loan&#39; category, which consists of loans with a loan status of &#39;Fully
Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
3. Good Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as
&#39;Good Loans.&#39; This includes the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of &#39;Fully
Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
4. Good Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from
borrowers for &#39;Good Loans,&#39; which encompasses all payments made on loans with a
loan status of &#39;Fully Paid&#39; and &#39;Current.&#39;
Bad Loan KPIs:
1. Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculating the percentage of loan applications
categorized as &#39;Bad Loans.&#39; This category specifically includes loans with a loan status
of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
2. Bad Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications categorized
as &#39;Bad Loans,&#39; which consists of loans with a loan status of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
3. Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as &#39;Bad
Loans.&#39; This comprises the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of &#39;Charged
Off.&#39;
4. Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from
borrowers for &#39;Bad Loans,&#39; which includes all payments made on loans with a loan
status of &#39;Charged Off.&#39;
Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the
performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by &#39;Loan Status.&#39; This
report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators
associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as &#39;Total Loan
Applications,&#39; &#39;Total Funded Amount,&#39; &#39;Total Amount Received,&#39; &#39;Month-to-Date (MTD)
Funded Amount,&#39; &#39;MTD Amount Received,&#39; &#39;Average Interest Rate,&#39; and &#39;Average Debt-to-
Income Ratio (DTI),&#39; this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess
the health of our loan portfolio.

Dashboard&#39; that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan
data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics
and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-
friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users
seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
## DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE
Bank loans are a crucial financial tool that enables individuals and businesses to achieve
their goals and manage financial needs. However, it&#39;s essential for borrowers to understand
the terms, costs, and responsibilities associated with loans to make informed financial
decisions.
Banks collect loan data through various channels and processes, including:
Loan Applications: When individuals or businesses apply for loans, they submit detailed
applications that include personal and financial information. This data is collected
electronically or in paper form.
Credit Reports: Banks often access credit reports from credit bureaus when assessing a
borrower&#39;s creditworthiness. These reports contain information about a person&#39;s credit
history, existing loans, and payment behaviour.
Internal Records: Banks maintain internal records of loan transactions, including
disbursements, repayments, and loan status changes. These records are generated and
stored in the bank&#39;s database.
Online Portals: Many banks offer online platforms where borrowers can apply for loans,
make payments, and access account information. Data from these portals is collected and
stored for analysis.
Third-party Data Sources: Some banks may use external data sources, such as income
verification services, to gather additional information about borrowers.

Process of Granting a Loan
Loan Application:
The process begins when a customer submits a loan application to a bank or lending
institution. This application can be submitted in person, online, or through other channels.
Application Review:
The lending institution reviews the loan application and collects necessary documentation,
such as income statements, credit reports, and identification documents.
Identity Verification:
One of the initial checks is to verify the applicant&#39;s identity. This helps ensure that the
applicant is who they claim to be and prevents identity theft.
Credit Check:
A crucial step is to perform a credit check on the applicant. This involves accessing their
credit report from credit bureaus. Lenders evaluate the applicant&#39;s credit history, credit
score, and any past delinquencies or defaults.
Income Verification:
Lenders assess the applicant&#39;s ability to repay the loan by verifying their income. This may
involve reviewing pay stubs, tax returns, or other income documentation.
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) Check:
Lenders calculate the applicant&#39;s DTI, which is the ratio of their monthly debt payments to
their monthly income. A lower DTI indicates better repayment capacity.
Employment Verification:
Lenders may contact the applicant&#39;s employer to verify their employment status and length
of employment. Stable employment history is often seen as a positive factor.
Collateral Assessment (if applicable):
If the loan is secured by collateral, such as a home or a car, the lender evaluates the value
and condition of the collateral.
Risk Assessment:
Lenders assess the overall risk associated with the loan. This includes considering the
applicant&#39;s credit risk, income stability, and the purpose of the loan.
Loan Approval or Denial:
Based on the information gathered and the risk assessment, the lender makes a decision to
approve or deny the loan application. If approved, the lender determines the loan amount,
interest rate, and terms.
Loan Agreement:
If the loan is approved, the lender provides the applicant with a loan agreement that
outlines the terms and conditions, including the interest rate, repayment schedule, and any
fees.
Disbursement of Funds:
Once the loan agreement is signed by both parties, the lender disburses the funds to the
borrower. The borrower can use the funds for the specified purpose.
Repayment:
The borrower is responsible for making regular loan payments as specified in the loan
agreement. This includes repaying the principal amount along with interest.
Ongoing Monitoring:
Lenders continue to monitor the loan throughout its term, including tracking payments,
assessing the borrower&#39;s financial health, and managing any delinquencies or defaults.

Reasons for Analysing Bank Loan Data:
Banks analyse loan data for several critical reasons:
Risk Assessment: One of the primary purposes of analysing loan data is to assess the risk
associated with lending to a particular individual or business. Banks use data to evaluate the
creditworthiness of borrowers, predict default probabilities, and determine interest rates
and lending terms.
Decision-making: Loan data analysis supports the decision-making process when evaluating
loan applications. Banks use data-driven models and algorithms to make informed lending
decisions, such as approving or denying loan requests.
Portfolio Management: Banks manage portfolios of loans, including mortgages, personal
loans, and business loans. Data analysis helps banks monitor the health of these portfolios,
identify underperforming loans, and optimize loan terms and pricing.
Fraud Detection: Banks use data analysis to detect fraudulent loan applications and
activities. Unusual patterns, inconsistencies, or discrepancies in loan data can trigger fraud
alerts.
Regulatory Compliance: Banks are subject to regulatory requirements that mandate the
collection and reporting of loan data. Compliance with regulations such as the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations requires
data analysis and reporting.
Customer Insights: Analysing loan data provides insights into customer behaviour,
preferences, and needs. Banks can use these insights to tailor loan products and marketing
strategies to specific customer segments.
Profitability Analysis: Banks assess the profitability of their loan portfolios by analysing data
related to interest income, loan origination costs, default rates, and collection efforts.
Market Research: Data analysis helps banks understand market trends, competitive
landscape, and customer demand. This information guides product development and
market expansion strategies.
Credit Risk Management: Banks continuously monitor and manage credit risk associated
with their loans. Data analysis helps in setting risk management strategies, provisioning for
potential losses, and stress testing loan portfolios.
Customer Retention: Banks use data analysis to identify opportunities for retaining existing
customers, such as offering loan refinancing options or additional financial products.
